# brick-breaker-game [Brick-Blast-Blitz]
This project, Brick-Blast-Blitz, is a simple and fun brick-breaker game developed in Java using Swing for the graphical interface. The game features a player-controlled paddle that bounces a ball to break bricks arranged in a grid. Players must prevent the ball from falling below the paddle and break all the bricks to win. The game also includes the following features:
1. MySQL Database Integration: Player scores are saved in a MySQL database with their usernames.
2. Dynamic Map Generation: Bricks are dynamically generated on the game screen using the MapGenerator class.
3. Basic Game Mechanics: Players can move the paddle left and right, and the game handles collision detection for the ball, paddle, and bricks.
4. Score Tracking: Players earn points by breaking bricks, and their final score is displayed when the game is over.

The project is designed for beginners looking to explore game development with Java and database connectivity.
